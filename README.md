### Description:

>“External things are not the problem. It’s your assessment of them. Which you can erase right now.”
>
>– Marcus Aurelius

*This project is a nod to Ryan Holiday's "The Obstacle is the Way" and all Stoic philosophers.  Also a chance to practice JavaScript.*

*Demonstrates a search bar that uses key-up event listeners and logic comparisons to decide which entries to show or hide based on user input.*
